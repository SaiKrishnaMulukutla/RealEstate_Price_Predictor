# Real Estate Price Predictor

## Description
Real Estate Price Predictor is a powerful and interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to estimate property prices in Bangalore based on various inputs like location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. The app is powered by a Machine Learning regression model trained on historical real estate data and engineered with domain knowledge, statistical techniques, and performance optimization strategies.

This app is ideal for home buyers, real estate investors, and property analysts looking to get quick and data-driven price estimates.
